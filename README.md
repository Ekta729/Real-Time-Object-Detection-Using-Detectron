**Detectron2** is Facebook AI Research's next generation library that provides state-of-the-art detection and segmentation algorithms. It is the successor of Detectron and maskrcnn-benchmark. It supports a number of computer vision research projects and production applications in Facebook.

## Getting Started

We have build a real-time **Bat and Ball** tracking system. We approached the problem statement  in two phases:
1) Any algorithm is of no use if data is not good. So very first we converted given dataset in one of the standard object detection dataset formats like COCO, PASAL-VOC etc. Doing this made my dataset compatible with lot of open source algorithms and frameworks. We chose COCO format as it involved much more complexities in implementation.
